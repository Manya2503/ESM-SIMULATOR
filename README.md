# ESM-SIMULATOR ðŸ§¬
In the protein universe, not all protein structures are experimentally validated so novel technologies like AlphaFold were introduced to predict protein structures by mapping them with protein homology. ESM is a database introduced by META AI that uses AI language models to predict protein structures. This ESM Simulator application accesses those databases to predict protein structures along with their downloadable PDB files and plDTT scores to analyse accuracy.
